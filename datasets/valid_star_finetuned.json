        "predict_process": "The current negotiation is progressing positively, as the buyer has expressed interest in the apartment and engaged in discussions about the pricing and amenities. However, the buyer has introduced a significant counteroffer of $800 per month, which is considerably below the already negotiated price of $936 (with the application fee waived and the first month free). My goal should be to maintain the value of the property while accommodating the buyer’s need for affordability, but without compromising too much on the price. Given that the buyer mentions being new to the area and having tight finances, it is important to show understanding while also clearly stating the limits of what can be offered. I can propose a slightly better deal than 936, such as 925 or 930, but I should stand firm against the $800 offer.

        "predict_process": "The current negotiation has progressed to a point where the buyer is seeking a significant reduction in the monthly rent, currently at an already discounted price of $936, down to $850. The seller has demonstrated flexibility by offering reduced rent to $926 and included amenities like access to the gym. However, the buyer's request for $850 is quite a stretch from the seller's previously stated maximum limit. The goal should be to maintain the integrity of the offer while trying to accommodate the buyer's financial constraints, but without conceding too much. Aiming for a closer reduction while still providing value in other forms (such as amenities) is essential. Based on the analysis, the response is \"Again I am sorry but that is pushing it to the max.
