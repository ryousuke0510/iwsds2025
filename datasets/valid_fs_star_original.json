        "predict_process": "The buyer has expressed interest in purchasing all the phones but is insisting on a price of $400 each, which is well below the target selling price of $650. The seller has communicated that this price is too low, indicating there is room for negotiation but that the seller still values the phones higher. The buyer has positioned their request as a bulk purchase for a corporate swag bag, which may provide leverage for additional discounts. Given the volume (10 phones) the buyer wants, it would be effective for the seller to offer a more reasonable price that is still above $400 to keep the deal attractive but also maintain a potential profit margin. An appropriate goal may be to aim for around $550 each if the buyer is serious about purchasing in bulk.\n\nBased on the analysis, the response is \"I appreciate your interest in buying all 10 phones! While $400 each is too low for me, I could let them go for $550 each. That's a substantial discount for a bulk purchase, and I believe it reflects their value.\" </s>",
